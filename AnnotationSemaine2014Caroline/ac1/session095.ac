<laugh> not maybe not anything that would interest you52590	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	oh why not58400	recording19_session095_Spike_user	you don't you don't look like a very positive person you look very pessimistic60680	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	i don't think i'm pessimistic i'm a realist74820	recording19_session095_Spike_user	a realist em why why do you not think you're pessimistic i mean so far you haven't made any attempt to see the positive side of me you've only emphasised the negatives so i i wouldn't agree with that75610	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	well i say what i see87830	recording19_session095_Spike_user	well that's you haven't given any just reason it's very well to say something but you have to back it up with evidence an so far you've just said you look like this but you haven't given any concrete evidence90110	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	ok well tell me somethin about yourself then93950	recording19_session095_Spike_user	ok well i'm i'm a teaching fellow at queen's94350	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	mhm101180	recording19_session095_Spike_user	em i teach psychology statistics and cognitive psychology quite a sporty person101670	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	mhm105160	recording19_session095_Spike_user	i like to play squash and go to the gym in my spare time eh106710	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	playing squash107080	recording19_session095_Spike_user	yeah108280	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	do you like the competition116130	recording19_session095_Spike_user	i i'm not a really competitive person but sometimes i can be a little bit i think it's good it's just good from you know116330	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	mh119680	recording19_session095_Spike_user	and it's good exercise as well em i don't rea124160	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	but it feels feels good to be in competition with people sometimes let the aggression out every now and again127380	recording19_session095_Spike_user	oh yeah well yeah it's a it's like a former catharsis isn't it really127580	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	mh129660	recording19_session095_Spike_user	you know channel that aggression130330	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	yeah132150	recording19_session095_Spike_user	you have to channel it somewhere really132980	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	hm136180	recording19_session095_Spike_user	an it's better to do that than to do it in more negative ways141060	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	mhm so where if you were channelling your aggression into squash where does it come from146230	recording19_session095_Spike_user	well i think everybody experiences a little bit of frustration in their everyday lives150080	recording19_session095_Spike_user	and i think anybody that says they don't is possibly lying you know150180	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	mhm150280	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	mhm152480	recording19_session095_Spike_user	like things don't always work out eh153440	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	exactly158180	recording19_session095_Spike_user	as you would like but you know you ha you have to see the the good and the bad so ya know there's good bits during158670	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	mh159910	recording19_session095_Spike_user	day and there's bad bits during the day162140	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	an what kind of things frustrate you during your day167930	recording19_session095_Spike_user	em things like you know not getting things published you know168460	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	mh176380	recording19_session095_Spike_user	cause sometimes journal editors not wanting your work you know an sometimes being a bit over harsh although i understand they can't publish all good work177070	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	mh182680	recording19_session095_Spike_user	so you have to take that into account an you also have to sort a take their advice on board and try to make things better in the future183280	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	mh183840	recording19_session095_Spike_user	cha185850	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	but it's frustrating when you know your work is good though204490	recording19_session095_Spike_user	yes y absolutely em and tha that's just one of the the downsides of it em and yeah so something like squash is good for venting that that frustration em sometimes i think there sometimes i agree with them and think yes fair enough and sometimes i think204680	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	mhm206720	recording19_session095_Spike_user	they have been over harsh209860	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	how do you feel when you get comments that are really harsh229330	recording19_session095_Spike_user	em well th well initially i think very frustrated and then i would probably try to sit back and think about things more logically an more constructively once you get that initial frustration you know that emotional reaction out of the way you can see things more clearly so i would get230020	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	mh230940	recording19_session095_Spike_user	t a second opinion you know231580	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	mhm231980	recording19_session095_Spike_user	because sometimes233090	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	sometimes they're idiots237680	recording19_session095_Spike_user	sometimes they're idiots and sometimes i maybe have got it wrong myself you know so get a second opinion249680	recording19_session095_Spike_user	try an review their criticism in a constructive way work out what they are saying is correct an what they're saying isn't based on that you know what you need to take on board an what you don't250670	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	mh257880	recording19_session095_Spike_user	an sometimes you know sometimes what they say isn't very useful because they've criticised you just for not agreeing with their opinion258680	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	mh261870	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	mh267980	recording19_session095_Spike_user	which i i don't think is fair and some reviewers are like that and they just don't want you to be publishing anything that's against their opinion well that's quite sad really268550	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	yeah269040	recording19_session095_Spike_user	yeah270100	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	that is k pretty sad275280	recording19_session095_Spike_user	but they do they do it you know an i think editors probably see that as well which is quite good cause you know275700	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	mh279370	recording19_session095_Spike_user	hopefully look at things and see things as they are282430	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	unless the editor's just the same as the reviewers305310	recording19_session095_Spike_user	well tha that can happen as well although the the difference between an editor an reviewer is that the editor em is more likely to be in the general area that you're involved in and mightn't be an expert and have a strong opinion on things whereas a reviewer they're they're gonna be asked because it's their specialism an they'll they could have quite strong views on that area305880	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	mh316380	recording19_session095_Spike_user	i would hope that in most instances the editor would be less biased of course that might not always be the case but i think in most instances you know they're they're not gonna be commenting on work316680	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	mh324990	recording19_session095_Spike_user	that's you know very in their area that they may necessarily be very knowledgeable about so hopefully they can be as unbiased as possible329030	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	but then sometimes they're not and that's frustrating333730	recording19_session095_Spike_user	no but we're human's and human's aren't perfect an we're all prone to bias334630	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	no <breath>336650	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	mh352450	recording19_session095_Spike_user	you have to kind of accept that and tha that you just have to accept that in life sometimes things will go in your favour ok so fair enough sometimes you'll have a biased person that's totally against you because they don't agree with you and maybe you'll have things the other way around you you'll have a biased em reviewer who's totally for your viewpoint so354780	recording19_session095_Spike_user	you know hopefully in the end it all kind of356320	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	balances356690	recording19_session095_Spike_user	you know balances out361000	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	mh i see suppose that is quite a sensible approach really isn't it361680	recording19_session095_Spike_user	yeah362260	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	hm363890	recording19_session095_Spike_user	i hope i've made you a bit happier now366190	recording19_session095_Spike_operator	hm i'm not sure370330	recording19_session095_Spike_user	no well maybe maybe if i had more time to talk to you i could win you over but
