morning54160	recording24_session126_Spike_operator	<laugh> good that's what i like to hear a normal person who's a bit pissed off at life in the morning62470	recording24_session126_Spike_user	<laugh> it it's not till maybe about this time after lunch that i'll actually wake up so no i'm terrible in the morning68360	recording24_session126_Spike_operator	neh so what do you act like when you're getting up in the morning and somebody eh starts to annoy you83140	recording24_session126_Spike_user	i just generally don't talk to people in the morning at all i just stay away <laugh> until i have some coffee or a couple of hours of of light and then i'll start talking to people but usually i just i keep my head down and don't interact with anyone85750	recording24_session126_Spike_operator	what about someone's pestering you93740	recording24_session126_Spike_user	yeah if it's especially early in the morning em i'll more or less tend to ignore them99140	recording24_session126_Spike_operator	oh so you just let them continue to pester you and you just ignore them105460	recording24_session126_Spike_user	if i can get away from them i will but if i can't i'll just make excuses and pretend i'm doing something else107040	recording24_session126_Spike_operator	do not get annoyed though112790	recording24_session126_Spike_user	ah you do but you can take it out in different ways i just e-mail somebody and go oh my head's wrecked114920	recording24_session126_Spike_operator	oh yeah and have a bit of a moan about it115580	recording24_session126_Spike_user	ye119250	recording24_session126_Spike_operator	eh but then you know you're kind of letting them walk all over you a bit are you not130770	recording24_session126_Spike_user	no because sure it's only petty things really that would annoy me so what's the point in saying anything if it's only something small that's only annoying me at that moment in time if they said it later i'd be fine you know131710	recording24_session126_Spike_operator	hm132830	recording24_session126_Spike_user	it's my problem not theirs138530	recording24_session126_Spike_operator	hm its a bit of a strange attitude though people are really annoying142250	recording24_session126_Spike_user	ah but you can't be going around s speaking your mind all the time143160	recording24_session126_Spike_operator	why not150040	recording24_session126_Spike_user	<laugh> cause people will end up really not wanting to be near you at all and you'll be very isolated in the151760	recording24_session126_Spike_operator	or they'll respect you for it156540	recording24_session126_Spike_user	it's not the approach i go for anyway159610	recording24_session126_Spike_operator	what about if someone really really annoys you166660	recording24_session126_Spike_user	oh then i'll say it and i'll tell them why they're annoying me but you know unless it would had it would have to be something pretty big169020	recording24_session126_Spike_operator	to get aggressive with someone169410	recording24_session126_Spike_user	yeah178640	recording24_session126_Spike_operator	hm i see so what what would you say to eh you know if you're ranting to someone else185560	recording24_session126_Spike_user	i'm ranting to somebody else about something that's annoying me or i'm giving out to them if186790	recording24_session126_Spike_operator	about something else189860	recording24_session126_Spike_user	oh god i go on brilliant rants eh190720	recording24_session126_Spike_operator	about what205810	recording24_session126_Spike_user	just really annoying things like people em car drivers drive me mental i have a license and i can drive i just don't have a car and people that park up on the kerb so that you can't actually walk on the footpath they drive me mad206540	recording24_session126_Spike_operator	yeah213080	recording24_session126_Spike_user	em and those methody kids are always outside my office they drive me mad214620	recording24_session126_Spike_operator	making loads of noise219140	recording24_session126_Spike_user	yeah i've you know they just i go on rants about them i have gone out to give out to the kids219970	recording24_session126_Spike_operator	have you220840	recording24_session126_Spike_user	just once222180	recording24_session126_Spike_operator	what happened242430	recording24_session126_Spike_user	i find i find them in the building and i i used to work in methody at one point em so i adopted the whole teacher approach going now should you really be in here em one of the guys his friends had locked him into the building so i gave out to the friends but yeah no they're just loud very very loud and just always making a mess outside it's impossible to get out of the building at four246200	recording24_session126_Spike_operator	well i'm glad you did something about it its good250000	recording24_session126_Spike_user	eh they're still there <laugh> so it wasn't very effective253800	recording24_session126_Spike_operator	hm you not tempted to do something else to get rid of them257160	recording24_session126_Spike_user	well i don't think there is much i can do261060	recording24_session126_Spike_operator	hm its a bit of a defeatist attitude it doesn't sound like you274670	recording24_session126_Spike_user	no its well like the school couldn't do anything and you know i was thinking about that but i'm pretty sure i was wondering if cause they're still in their school uniform whether the school would be able to implement275660	recording24_session126_Spike_operator	hm280110	recording24_session126_Spike_user	and any sort of rules but like i said i worked in methody and it's very unlikely that they're286070	recording24_session126_Spike_operator	useless oh right i'm kind of sick of talking to you now286810	recording24_session126_Spike_user	right290430	recording24_session126_Spike_operator	em you can speak to poppy or obadiah293070	recording24_session126_Spike_user	i'll go for obadiah sure294490	recording24_session126_Spike_operator	alright bye294640	recording24_session126_Spike_user	bye
