8340	recording12_session053_Prudence_operator	hi9450	recording12_session053_Prudence_user	hello10650	recording12_session053_Prudence_operator	my name's prudence11020	recording12_session053_Prudence_user	<breath>24590	recording12_session053_Prudence_operator	i'm a level headed sort of person and i like to think that there's a practical solution for everything em can you tell me what have you been doing with your eh in your recent past what have you been doing33240	recording12_session053_Prudence_user	em at the moment i'm doing trying to complete a phd em in psychology so most of my time at the moment is basically just spent trying to write36740	recording12_session053_Prudence_operator	aha that sounds like a very sensible thing to be doing37340	recording12_session053_Prudence_user	<laugh>38800	recording12_session053_Prudence_operator	are you enjoying doing that61330	recording12_session053_Prudence_user	em it's coming and going at the moment i'll be i'm actually not enjoying it because i've reached a bit of a wall where i just seem to sit at my desk and stare into space and desperately wait for the inspiration to come but it's not coming you know the actual f it takes so much time to write one sentence and em i think i'm having a bit of a downhill moment this week but i'm hoping the motivation will come back next week64360	recording12_session053_Prudence_operator	yes well there's ups and downs in all things in life64800	recording12_session053_Prudence_user	mhm67980	recording12_session053_Prudence_operator	em it just takes a bit of perserverance and then you'll get there68470	recording12_session053_Prudence_user	mhm73130	recording12_session053_Prudence_operator	em what do you think eh what are the good bits and what are the hard bits107540	recording12_session053_Prudence_user	em em i think it is i think the hardest bit is just starting off i actually have an outline written out cause i'm very into making outlines and my lists and things like that so that when i've completed any small task it can be ticked off and that i always find very good at motivating me but at the moment for some reason my the only part i haven't done in my outline is the very first bullet point that i need to write say a page on but because it's the very first part of this piece of writing it seems to be the hardest to come out and that i'm finding the hardest probably just writing the start <laugh> as strange as it sounds110530	recording12_session053_Prudence_operator	yeah yeah i know it's often it's often difficult to get a beginning111150	recording12_session053_Prudence_user	mhm114310	recording12_session053_Prudence_operator	and em sometimes it's the starts best written at the end114640	recording12_session053_Prudence_user	yeah118960	recording12_session053_Prudence_operator	em ok and a do you think it's going well do you think145600	recording12_session053_Prudence_user	em i think i think it's going well it's very hard to tell because writing so much isn't something i've done in a long time ya know i've spen feel like i've spent the past three years developing things in other areas like the actual carrying out of data or presenting but it's been so long since i've actually just had to sit down and write pages and pages that ya know there's a part of me that worries that maybe ya know it's been so long that maybe i have lost the skill and it'll just take a bit longer to come back146280	recording12_session053_Prudence_operator	aha159150	recording12_session053_Prudence_user	but i keep telling myself that once i get into more of a swing of it then it'll become easier cause i remember being an undergrad and i used to quite enjoy writing i used to just like sorta sitting in the library cut shutting myself off and typing away so i think i'm just waiting for that to come back really164230	recording12_session053_Prudence_operator	yeah yeah i'm sure it will i'm sure with a eh a bit of hard work and dedication everything will turn out ok164680	recording12_session053_Prudence_user	mhm171680	recording12_session053_Prudence_operator	em and eh in your em outside of that of your work what are you doing in183780	recording12_session053_Prudence_user	em i think the biggest thing i'm doing at the moment actually is i have a friend who's got getting married in the summer an i'm organising her hen party for next month so that's pretty much all i'm focussed on outside of work at the moment187550	recording12_session053_Prudence_operator	yes ok it doesn't sound like a sensible thing to be doing ya know think200590	recording12_session053_Prudence_user	no <laugh> well you'd be surprised this is a very sensible friend of mine so actually yes i'm trying to organise what she refers to as a sensible dignified hen which is quite dull in a way i'm trying to find ways of being eh sensible on a hen and it's harder than you would think but <laugh>203750	recording12_session053_Prudence_user	<laugh>205050	recording12_session053_Prudence_operator	s well it sounds a very easy eh wise friend that you have to be taking a sensible approach there211100	recording12_session053_Prudence_operator	em and do you think eh will it be eh an enjoyable time231710	recording12_session053_Prudence_user	i think it will be cause em i think again this is just cause i i rea i enjoy organising things like this and this is back to my whole idea of lists and everything and i have all my lists made out of what's going to happen all three days of the weekend and i think a lot of the stuff planned out it's goin to be very nice n quite calm and it should just be a nice relaxing weekend with a few drinks thrown in238570	recording12_session053_Prudence_operator	ok yes that sounds good that sounds like a wise way to em spend that particular kind of night239300	recording12_session053_Prudence_user	<laugh>245660	recording12_session053_Prudence_operator	em what about em in the longer term what are your plans for the future273420	recording12_session053_Prudence_user	em i don't actually have a long term plan at the moment i know i should be applying for jobs at the moment but my problem is i'm not quite sure what i want to apply for so i have actually applied for a few things my logic at the moment is just apply for anything that looks remotely interesting ya know and if nothing else at least it'll keep me looking and it'll keep the whole job applying skills going but em i've only applied for two things so far and haven't actually heard back from either of them yet274330	recording12_session053_Prudence_operator	mhm279410	recording12_session053_Prudence_user	but just knowing that i'm trying and looking is making me feel better than doing absolutely nothing at all280450	recording12_session053_Prudence_operator	yeah yeah280570	recording12_session053_Prudence_user	but289000	recording12_session053_Prudence_operator	well i'm sure with a bit of em time spent in that direction things will work out for the best em and are you happy292630	recording12_session053_Prudence_user	em in general yes295070	recording12_session053_Prudence_operator	m that's good that's good i'm glad to hear that295830	recording12_session053_Prudence_user	<breath>
